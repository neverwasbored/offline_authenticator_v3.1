## About

It's your friend - offline authenticator. Supports as many accounts as your PC can handle.

## Documentation

In package only one file supports (pairs_bitmart.json), but you can add 2 more for yourself!
This app is supportable, you can feedback about any problems or suggestions.
And I want to note that I'm a beginner, so don't be too strict. You can compile this project (nuitka tested).
You can add accounts in app or you can paste to json file.
